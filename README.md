### Redux

The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.

Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

State is read-only: The only way to mutate the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

###  Redux Middleware

Redux middleware is designed by creating functions that can be composed together before the main dispatch method is invoked. The dispatch function is responsible for sending actions to one or many reducer functions for state changes. The composed specialized functions around the original dispatch method creates the new middleware capable dispatch method.
